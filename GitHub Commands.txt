Working with Git/GitHub
=======================

Step#1: Create a remote repository in GitHub.

Step#2: Create a local repository in local machine (e.g. Project Folder.)

Step#3: Initialize the local repository.
git init

Step#4: Connect local repository to GitHub remote repository.
git remote add origin 'https://github.com/chanchal-github/FrontEndDev.git' 

Step#5: This local repository has branch name as Master, but the remote name is Main. Therefore rename local to Main to keep in sync with Remote repository. Otherwise Push / Pull will fail.
git branch -m master main

Step#6: Pull the project folder/main repository from GitHub to Local repository before starting the project work.
git pull origin main 
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories  [if above command fails, then use this one]

Step#7: Work on local repository. Amend / Add / Delete Files.

Step#8: Check status of local reposity, untracked files, if any.
git status

Step#9: Add files to index. Otherwise Commit will not work.
git add 'GitHub Commands.txt'

Step#10: Commit the changes in local repository.
git commit -a -m "first time commit to main"

Step#11: Push the files to "main" branch of remote repository.
git push origin main
